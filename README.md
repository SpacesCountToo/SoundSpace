# SoundSpace
A tool to sonify astronomical images as a novel medium for blind/visually 
impaired observers. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies:
* Python 2.7.12 or greater (Python 3 won't work (for now))
* A pair of headphones (as long as it's stereo)
* A music player of sorts: whatever's default will work.

Python Libraries:
* AstroPy
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib (for graphing)
* TKinter (for personal use, for easier image selection)

If you don't have the libraries, you can use Pip to install, or just google 
"how to install X" where X is the library you want.

### How to Install:
Just download the zip file, then run main.py in python(for now: will try to add 
some cool installer maybe?)

I don't actually know how this works. If you want to contribute, hit me with 
a pull request or something. I check my email about 3 times a month  if I'm 
honest.
